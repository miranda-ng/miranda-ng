This is a thingy for compacting wasted space in your Miranda database and
fixing inconsistencies that may have been introduced.

To keep it simple and robust, Miranda will not by itself reclaim any blank
space created by deleting information from its profile databases, so this tool
will do that for you. It can also fix some problems that may occur in rare
circumstances. Since it also re-writes the database in a more sensible order
(a bit like defragmenting your hard disk) you may find that you get a speed
improvement in Miranda by running your database through this tool.

Todo: There is no support for any command line parameters to allow for
unattended operation yet, and it would be helpful if there was better
integration with Miranda to allow compaction when necessary. It's also
possible to fix a larger range of faults than it currently can do, but that
requires significantly more work.
