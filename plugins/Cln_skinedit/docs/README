

    Skin Item Editor for clist_nicer+
    ---------------------------------
    
  This is basically the revamped UI which could previously be found as the
  Background+ page in the contact list options. It has been outsourced into an
  extra plugin (cln_skinedit.dll)
  
  The UI has been reworked and a few features have been added:
  
  * Ignored items appear in red color in the list box
   
  * A context menu has been added to the list box which allows to quick copy 
    settings from one items to all items which are currently selected in the
    list box.
    
  * prettier UI, faster dialog updating, less flickering.       
 
 
  planned features:
  -----------------
  
  * Ability to edit image-based skin items.
  * button editor (for skinnable contact list buttons)
