; This is a sample help package, documenting the file format.
; For some example help text look at the end of the file.


; *** GENERAL ***
; Blank lines and lines starting with ; are ignored.
; You cannot use "[identifier]   ;this is a comment"
; The first line must be maintained as-is, or the file will not be recognised
; Subsequent lines are in HTTP header format. Do not translate anything before
; the :
;
; You normally do not need to restart Miranda IM for changes in this file to take effect.
; When you add a new context identifier to this file it will be loaded on next request.
; However, when you update an existing context identifier and you opened up the
; associated dialog before, you might need to wait until the cache period has elapsed.
; The chache can be configured in the help options.
;
; Spaces are trimmed from the beginning and end of all strings before parsing.
; Context identifiers that cannot be found in this file will show "No help available".
;
; If a context identifier is duplicated, the first occurence in the file will be used.



; *** HELP TEXTS ***
; Help texts are formated using regular text which also can contain
; some simple HTML code.
;
; An entry in the help file looks like this:
;
; [context_identifier]
; Some text shown as title=Some text<br>that might contain simple html code
;
; A list of available HTML tags that might be helpful when writing
; help texts:
; styles:     <i>italic</i>, <b>bold</b>, <u>underlined</u>
; linebreak:  <br>
; sizes:      <big>large text</big>, <small>tiny text</small>
; hyperlinks: <a href="url">link title</a>
; paragraph:  <p>text</p>
; colors:     <font color="#hexcode">colored text</font>
;  instead of #hexcode you can also use the following 16 default color names:
;  black, maroon, green, olive, navy, purple, teal, silver,
;  gray, red, lime, yellow, blue, fuchsia, aqua, white

; Be careful when using those html tags.
; Do not use them massively, instead pick them when appropriate to
; guide the reader. Keep in mind that it is still a *help* text.
;	
; Some special symbols must be specified differently:
; instead of < use &lt;
; instead of > use &gt;
; instead of & use &amp;
; instead of " use &quot; 
; A space can be also specified as &nbsp;
;
; To specify a specific Unicode character
; you can use a special numeric representation:
; &#[x][Number];
; Examples: &#945; &#x3B1;
; When you place an x in in front the number needs to be hexadecimal.
 
; If you maintain a help package and want to find out for which element you can write a help text
; just do the following:
; When you press the 'ctrl' key while opening up the context help tooltip
; it will display the help identifier used in the help file instead of
; the help text. You can use this identifier to add your help text to the text file.
; When you press 'ctrl'+C when a helptip is already opened, its text will get
; copied to clipboard.
;

; If you would like to assign one single help text to multiple context identifiers just group the
; identifiers together. The following shows for both identifiers the same text:
; [identifier1]
; [identifier2]
; title=text



; *** GUIDELINES ***
; (Subject to change)
; * Avoid the words 'This is...' or 'This shows...' or something like that at the beginning of
;   a help tip. It is a bit annoying when every tip begins with the same words.
;   Example: A tip could begin immediately by 'Shows... or 'Allows you...')
; * Try to use efficient language to express everything is a quick manner.
; * Use correct language ;) I know this is difficult.
;   Hint: MS Word helps a lot for language checking the whole helppack ;)
;   Use English (GB) for the default english helppack.
; * Bundle together logically individable cuntext-identifiers.
;   Radio buttons should not show a different text for each. Instead, create one single helptext
;   for all grouped together radio buttons. However, this is not a 'fixed' quideline. Let's see when it is appropriate.
; * Always use the term 'Miranda IM' (not just 'Miranda') when you refer to
;   the whole application. We have to keep this consistent somehow.
; * Please try to avoid refering to 'Miranda IM' as a whole.
;   Try to reformulate the sentence when you would like to use that term.
;   When reformulating is not possible, its usage is all right.

; Some guidelines about links in the help texts:
; Those <a href> tags should be used _very_ rarely.
; I think a good rule is: No use of href tags in general. Use them only in exceptional and reasonable situations.
; Do not set links just because it is possible.
; Ah...and only link to offical sources as help.miranda-im.org (at least for the default helppack)
; Linking to following pages is general no good idea:
; - inofficial pages
: - (wiki) pages being still empty or almost empty
; - forum threads (forums do not provide instant help, summarize important points instead)
; The help yearning user wan't to work with the window and not dig through some webpage.
; If he would like to visit the forum he would not do so directly.
; Acceptable links are (for example):
; - wiki links to help.miranda-im.org
; Warning: A link to http://help.miranda-im.org/Plugin:SmileyAdd is not a good idea.
; The user does not need general info about the plugin anymore because he already installed it!
; Another Warning: Just a link in the helptip is not very helpful.
; Links can only be an enrichment and not sole purpose on the tip.
;
; A very good academic ;) example for a link would be the following:
; http://help.miranda-im.org/Installing_smileys_in_Miranda
; Which could be placed on the tooltip of the '...' button of the 'Events'->'Smileys' page.
; Of course, with additional text describing it.



; *** HEADER ***
; The used Help Pack file can be selected using the Language Pack Manager plugin.
;
; The information that is shown in the options about your
; Help Pack file is taken from the header provided in that file.
; If you are the author of a langpack file, please make sure the information
; you give there accurate and does follow the offical rules.
;
; The information that is shown in the options about your
; Help Pack file is taken from the header provided in that file.
; If you are the author of a langpack file, please make sure the information
; you give there accurate and does follow the offical rules.
;
; The official names of the header tags and what they specify are described here:
; http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/miranda/trunk/miranda/i18n/readme.txt
; They are exactly the same as the ones for a Language Pack file.
;
; Following, I provide a summary of the available tags and
; I also provide some ideas on how those data should/could be formated.
; You do not need to follow those suggestions, but I think it would
; make the provided information more comfortable to read and more informative.

; 'Language' header:
; A full description of the language in the file, in English, e.g.
; "English (UK)", "English (US) humorous" or "German".
; This field should really be in in English so everybody knows what is is about.
; The string is translated using the current langpack before is is displayed.
;
; Just provide a country abbreviation in brackets if it is useful.
; A value of "French (fr-FR)" is not very senseful. "German (AT)" would be a useful example. 
; Just be a bit smart to find out when those brackets are necessary and when not.
; Several langpack files for the same language are possible using this field, e.g.
; "German" pack using "Sie" and "German (informal)" using "Du".

; 'Locale' header:
; The Windows language code. A complete list is available at
; http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/nls_238z.asp
; Please make sure this is a correct value and not the english one!

; 'Last-Modified-Using' header:
; Please keep this line up-to-date, containing the last version of Miranda IM
; you made changes with, so people can compare files containing the same
; language to see which is the most up-to-date. The formatting of the value is
; unimportant, as long as it's human-readable.
; However, it is more comfortable to read when all Language Packs use
; the same format.
; I think we could agree upon the following format: "Miranda IM 0.5"
; When you used an alpha build the following format fits well:
; "Miranda IM 0.5 alpha build #60" (as shown in About dialog).

; 'Authors' header:
; A list of people who have worked on this file. When you do something, add (or
; move) your name to the front, and put a comma (", ") between each name, e.g.
; "Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick"
; By the nature of the options dialog the place to display this value is very limited.
; Important and actively developing people should be listed first.
; Real names should be prefered instead of just nicknames. 

; 'Author-email' header:
; Should contain the e-mail of the person that last changed the file only, on the
; assumption that that person is qualified to manage the file.
; It is enough when the user knows one single email address he can write to. 
; If you would like that email address to be obfuscated and not to be retrievable by
; spambots or viruses scanning harddrives, you can use " at " instead of "@", e.g.
; "joe.farmer at miranda-im.org". This will be recognized by the plugin.

; 'Plugins-included' header:
; Contains a list of the plugins that are also translated in this file. It
; should be a comma-delimited list of the plugin DLL filenames!, e.g.:
; Plugins-included: splitmsgdialogs,import,historyp
; As stated in the official specification!
; You really should follow standards here.
; The Language Pack Manager uses this list to display a list of installed plugins
; that are not included in this package.
; "miranda32" or something like that does not really need to be listed here.
; The list is case-insensitive, but it is a good idea to use exactly the same
; case of the DLL file.
; Just use filenames of the plugin DLLs here, e.g.
; the plugin named "AimOSCAR.dll" should be listed as "AimOSCAR".
; It is a good idea to even include plugins into this list that do not have any dialogs
; where help can be shown, as "png2dib.dll".
; The inclusion list states which plugins are fully covered by context help texts.
; "png2dib" is, so it should be listed in the header.



; ** FILENAME ***
; Something about the 'helppack_*.txt' file name:
; To use the file, place it in the same directory as miranda32.exe, and call it
; helppack_*.txt where * can be anything, however it is recommended that it
; be the language.
; It makes sense when the * part of the file name is in English and lower case, e.g.
; "langpack_chineset.txt" for the "Chinese (Traditional)" package. 
; The file name is never displayed so there should be no problems with it being english.
; Please avoid using any other character than a-z, 0-9 in this name to keep it portable. 
; Important: Do not include a version number in the file name!
; It is very hard to update the file when the file name changes all the time.
; This might also result in multiple files of the same language
; listed in the options.



; *** EXAMPLES ***
; The rest of the file are some example help texts.
; All identifiers of the help plugin's option page are listed.

; Note: I used nonsense text, no productive helptexts...
