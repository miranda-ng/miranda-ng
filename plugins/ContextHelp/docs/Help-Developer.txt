Help Packs
-----------------
	Help texts are stored in a file named 'helppack_*.txt'
	To use the file, place it in the same directory as miranda32.exe, and call it
	helppack_*.txt where * can be anything, however it is recommended that it
	be the language.

	An entry in the help file looks like this:

	[context_identifier]
	Some text shown as title=Some text<br>that might contain simple html code

	IMPORTANT HINT:
	When you press the 'Ctrl' key while opening up the context help tooltip
	it will display the help identifier used in the help file, instead of
	the help text. This is helpful when writing your help file.
	When you press 'Ctrl'-C while a helptip is opened, its text will get
	copied to clipboard.

	A list of available HTML tags that might be helpful when writing
	help texts:
	styles:     <i>italic</i>, <b>bold</b>, <u>underlined</u>
	linebreak:  <br>
	sizes:      <big>large text</big>, <small>tiny text</small>
	hyperlinks: <a href="url">link title</a>
	paragraph:  <p>text</p>
	colors:	    <font color="#colorcode">colmred text</font>
	 instead of #hexcode you can also use the following 16 default color names:
	 black, maroon, green, olive, navy, purple, teal, silver,
	 gray, red, lime, yellow, blue, fuchsia, aqua, white

	Be careful when using those html tags.
	Do not use them massively, instead pick them when appropriate to
	guide the reader. Keep in mind that it is still a *help* text.

	Some special symbols must be specified differently:
	instead of < use &lt;
	instead of > use &gt;
	instead of & use &amp;
	instead of " use &quot; 
	A space can be also specified as &nbsp;

	To specify a specific Unicode character
	you can use a special numeric representation:
	&#[x][Number];
	Examples: &#945; and &#x3B1;
	When you place an x in in front the number needs to be hexadecimal.

	Please refer to 'helppack_sample.txt' for an example help file.

Translation
-----------------
	Translation strings for language pack maintainers can be found in
	'Help-Translation.txt'.

Debug Symbols
-----------------
	Debug symbols are also available for debugging purposes.
	Copy the PDB-files into the same directory as the
	corresponding DLL-files.
	To debug crashes the supplied MAP-file file might be helpful.

Coding Language
-----------------
	Help Plugin was written using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 SP6
	and the Microsoft Platform SDK shipped along with it.

	The project files for VS 7 and 8 (*.vcproj and *.vspscc) are not
	kept up-to-date.
	The working project files are the ones of VS 6 (*.dsw and *.dsp).

Rebase Info
-----------------
	Help Plugin has set its base address to:
	0x20100000

	Please avoid using this base address for your plugins because it will
	slow down the start of Miranda IM.
	Try to choose a unique base address for each plugin you create.

	Using Microsoft Visual C++, the base address can be configured at:
	'Project' -> 'Settings' -> 'Linker' -> 'Output' -> 'Base Address'
