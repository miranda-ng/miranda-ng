//! Service handling playlist file operations. There are multiple implementations handling different playlist formats; you can add new implementations to allow new custom playlist file formats to be read or written.\n
//! Also provides static helper functions for turning a filesystem path into a list of playable item locations. \n
//! Note that you should typically call playlist_incoming_item_filter methods instead of calling playlist_loader methods directly to get a list of playable items from a specified path; this way you get a core-implemented threading and abortable dialog displaying progress.\n
//! To register your own implementation, use playlist_loader_factory_t template.\n
//! To call existing implementations, use static helper methods of playlist_loader class.
