shlext 2.0.0.9

Info
=======================

This source code is based on shlext 1.0.6.6 with minor changes so that it works
with FreePascal 2.2.2.

The included headers (inc dir) are from Miranda 0.3.3.1 SDK and so if you want newer APIs
then get the API headers from the latest SVN tree.

Note: I have included v0.8.xx API changes for GUIDs within a new file (m_v8.inc)


How to build
=======================

Make sure you have installed the FreePascal compiler ( http://freepascal.org )
the latest version is 2.2.2 at the time of writing.

Run "make.bat" in this directory, this contains all the command line switches
for the newer version should produce shlext.dll
