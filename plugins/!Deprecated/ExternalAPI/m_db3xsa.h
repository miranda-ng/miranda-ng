This service routine expands all environment variables of a path string.
It supports:
%MIRANDAPATH%	- expands to the installation folder of miranda,
%PROFILEPATH%	- expands to the folder the current profile is stored in,
%PROFILENAME%	- expands to the name of the current profile,
and all windows like environment variables such as:
%USERPROFILE%, %WINDIR%, ...
It returns the length of the absolute path in characters on success or
0 if any of the environment variables was not translated.
wParam=relative source path ( must be smaller than MAX_PATH )
lParam=absolute destination path ( must be larger or equal to MAX_PATH )
