Version: 3.0
Created: August 2009

1. Overview
-----------

tabSRMM is an advanced messaging module for Miranda NG. It adds many new options and features to make instant messaging more
enjoyable and allows you to tweak almost every aspect of the message window to
fit your needs.

2. Some features:
-----------------

* "tabbed messaging". All message dialog windows are now opened within a "container"
   window. A simple tab bar can be used to switch between the message windows.
   Currently, there is only one container and no way to make one or more message
   windows "top level". You can define as many container windows as you want and
   assign your contacts to different containers. This allows you to organize your
   chat sessions in many different ways.

   If you dislike a tabbed interface for chatting, you can also configure a "single
   window mode" in which each session is opened in a separate window.

*  Lots of options to tweak the look of your message log.

*  Works with the external IEView plugin to give you a fully customizable message log
   using HTML templates and CSS.

*  Avatar support - both contacts and own avatars can be shown in the message dialog.

*  message templates for the message history in the chat window. You can freely define
   how messages will look like by using a powerful system of variables and templates.

*  built-in event notification system can announce messages and other events by using
   popups, system tray tooltips or On Screen Displa (announcing via poups or on screen
   display requires additional plugins).

*  WYSIWYG text editing in the message input box. Formatted text can be parsed to
   either BBCodes or simple */_ style formatting tags.

*  many features which make chatting more user friendly and easier. Some examples.

   * auto-select-and-copy: Selecting text in the message log history will automatically
     copy it to the clipboard. Holding down the ctrl key while selecting text will
     insert the selection in the edit box immediatly.

   * simplified mousewheel handling. No need to change the focus if you want to scroll
     the history log. Just move the mouse pointer over it and use the wheel.

   * Many hotkeys. Almost everything can be done without using the mouse.

   * option to minimize chat windows to the tray so they won't clutter your taskbar.
     A session list is available which can be used to access chat windows which have
     been minimized to the system tray.

*  A "favorite contact" list which can be used to access favorite contacts quickly.
   (Win 2000 or later).

*  Remembers the last 15 active sessions in a menu (Win 2000 or later).

*  System tray support.

*  integrated group chat module, based on chat.dll but merged into tabSRMM to give
   users a unified user interface for both IM and group chats (i.e. IRC channels).

6. Credits and thanks:
----------------------

Lots of people provided useful suggestions, feature requests and bug reports during
the development phase. I cannot name you all here, because it's just too many.

* The Miranda-IM development team and all contributors for making the best
  IM client on this planet (and probably in the entire universe :))

* sryo (teodalton@yahoo.com) for the minimal icons.

* Faith Healer for making icon packs, lots of suggestions, testing and
  feedback.

* the members on my own forum (http://www.miranda.or.at/forums/) for a lot
  of bug reports, feature suggestions and testing every new snapshot.

* Angeli-Ka for many bug reports and general feedback,  especially in the
  early phase of development when using tabSRMM could be really frustrating :)

  Also, for making the final icon set which is now distributed as default icon
  pack.

* Progame - for finding even the most carefully hidden bugs :)

* All other members of the Miranda community,  who helped with hunting down
  sometimes hard to find, bugs, and for suggesting features.

* "Mad Cluster" for the madmod patch which added a number of useful and often
   requested new features to the plugin.

* Joergen Persson for the original MUC ("multiuser chat") module for
  Miranda NG. Large parts of tabSRMM's multiuser chat integration are based
  on his code.
