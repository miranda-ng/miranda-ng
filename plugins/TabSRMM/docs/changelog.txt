	* MUC: added code for case-insensitive highlighting of messages
	  containing your own nick name.

	* finished v5 theme support (improved exporting and importing group
	  chat settings)

	  3.0 release.

Version 3.0.0.40 - 2010/07/10

	* various fixes and improvements for Windows 7 task bar support.

	* option to warn when closing a tab is gone. A replacement has been added which

	  one in the background.

	* task bar previews: removed placeholders and implemented real previews of
	  the message window contents.

	* redesigned container options dialog for better translations. Most
	  options now offer much more space for translated strings.

Version 3.0.0.36 - 2010/06/04 - released with Miranda 0.9.alpha#10

	* task bar support (Win 7), removed check for running DWM. Task bar tabs should
	  now work with classic and non-aero themes in Windows 7 (no thumbnails, though,
	  because they require Aero to be active).

	* renamed misleading option for task bar support as it implied to require an Aero
	  theme (which is not the case).

	* another tool bar rendering fix - don't use gradients for the tool bar background
	  at all with classic Windows theme, unless both tool bar background colors are
	  properly set.

	* Aero peek (task bar tabs) now default to enabled.

	  should now work.

	* autoclose tabs: converted to a more useful autoclose/autohide container
	  feature and moved to container options.

	* fixed a bug where installing a language pack could break hotkeys (translation
	  issue)

	* fixed "black tool bar bug" when classic windows theme is active on XP or later.

	* fixed crash when running on Windows 2000

	* cleaned up the mess in the TSButton class

	* More work on Aero Peek thumbnail previews. Added custom thumbnails for MUC chat
	  rooms and server windows.

	* updated msglog mark read code with some recent changes for srmm.


Version 3.0.0.33 - 2010/05/22

	* some issues fixed

	* improved compatibility for old (TabSRMM 2) skins

	* preliminary support for large status icons on the Windows 7 task bar (Miranda 0.9
	  required).

	* option to show avatars on task bar added to container settings (only
	  when running on Windows 7).

	* option to enable/disable Windows 7 task bar features removed (now always on,
	  when running on Windows 7).

	* Added aero peek for the Windows 7 task bar. Per tab thumbnails are partially
	  implemented, so you get a similar UI as seen in other tabbed applications
	  under Windows 7 (IE 8, Opera 10, for example). Still experimental, so it is
	  disabled by default (Message Sessions->Advanced tweaks is where you can enable
	  it). A Restart is required.

	  colors

	* fixed changelog URL for users of updater plugin and created new online
	  change log for TabSRMM 3 development versions

	  translation for "default").

Version 3.0.0.31 - 2010/05/xx

	* fixed drawing problem with animated info panel avatars

	* moved all legacy color settings to font service

	* added theme support for new color settings (+ updated theme version to
	  v5).

	* fixed issue with own nickname when it has not been set on the protocol's
	  option page (use own UID instead).


Version 3.0.0.30 - 2010/05/12

	* MUC: replaced (non working) log truncating with log rotation. Old log files
	  are archived when the size exceeds the maximum allowed length for a single
	  channel log file.

	* updated some dialogs to make more space for translations.

	* added UI button for quickly opening the MUC logs base folder.

	* implemented right and middle click actions for side bar buttons (close/context
	  menu)


Version 3.0.0.29 - 2010/05/11

	* fixed a number of drawing problems

	* DB tweak to force tool bar always use visual styles

	* added 2 new common colors for painting the UI in aero and visual styles
	  mode.

	  are new in TabSRMM 3.

	  is enabled.

	! using the own UIN as fallback for own nickname, to solve the "Unknown
	  Contact" problem which can appear when the own nickname is not
	  properly set.
	! fixed a few issues with global splitter positioning.
	* selecting offline sub protocol throws a warning instead of an error.
	- removed the feature to load a background image for the message input area.
