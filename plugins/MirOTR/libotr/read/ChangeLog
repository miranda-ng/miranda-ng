2005-06-24

	* README:
	* configure.ac:
	* packaging/fedora/libotr.spec:
	* src/version.h: Change version to 3.0.0 (but don't yet release)

	* Protocol: Clarify that, if the user requests to see the secure
	session id in the middle of the conversation, the value
	displayed should be the one calculated at the time the private
	connection was established (the last Key Exchange Message that
	caused a rekeying), _not_ the DH secure id calculated from DH
	keys in more recent Data Messages.

	* libotr.m4: Have the version check require an exact match on
	the major version, since, for example, source that expects
	libotr 2.0.0 won't work with libotr 3.0.0.

	* libotr.m4: Add #include <stdlib.h> to the version test so that
	it compiles cleanly with -Wall -Werror.

	* src/proto.c:
	* src/dh.h:
	* src/dh.c:
	* src/context.h:
	* src/context.c: Save the secure session id so that it can be
	displayed to the user upon request, instead of only when the
	private session is initially set up.

	* src/privkey.c:
	* src/context.h:
	* src/context.c: Allow the app to set a "trust level" for
	fingerprints.  This is an arbitrary string, intended to indicate
	whether (or possibly by what means) the user has verified that
	this fingerprint is accurate.

	* src/context.h:
	* src/context.c: Allow the app to set an arbitrary binary
	"preshared secret" for the ConnContext.  This is currently
	unused, but in the future it would allow for users to exchange a
	secret _before_ they generate their fingerprints.  [But the
	protocol would have to be extended to support this.]

	* src/message.h:
	* src/message.c: Remove the "confirm_fingerprint" callback
	which requires the user to acknowledge the new fingerprint
	before it can be used.  Replace it with a "new_fingerprint"
	callback which merely informs the user that a new fingerprint
	has been received.

2005-05-13

	* libotr.m4: Fixed a bug which made configure fail to find the
	libotr header files if they weren't in the standard place.

2005-05-09

	* src/privkey.c (otrl_privkey_read_fingerprints): Allow fields,
	particularly accountnames, to contain spaces.  Closes #1198379.

2005-05-03

	* README:
	* configure.ac:
	* packaging/fedora/libotr.spec:
	* src/version.h: Change version to 2.0.2

	* packaging/debian: Remove this directory, as Thibaut VARENE
	<varenet@debian.org> is now responsible for the debian packages.

2005-02-23

	* src/privkey.c (otrl_privkey_hash_to_human): Avoid writing a
	NUL one byte past the end of the buffer

2005-02-16

	* README:
	* configure.ac:
	* packaging/debian/changelog:

2005-02-15

	* src/message.c (otrl_message_sending, otrl_message_receiving)
	(otrl_message_disconnect):
	* src/proto.c (otrl_proto_accept_key_exchange)
	(otrl_proto_create_data, otrl_proto_accept_data): Don't send
	encrypted messages to a buddy who has disconnected his private
	connection with us.

	* src/message.c (otrl_message_sending): Don't show the user the
	"the last message was resent" notice if the message has never
	actually been sent before.

2005-02-09

	* src/proto.c (otrl_proto_create_data): Copy the msg before
	using since, since it may be an alias for context->lastmessage,
	which we're going to gcry_free().

	unencrypted messages in ALWAYS, but store them for
	retransmission later.
