REQUIREMENTS

To compile the OTR library and toolkit, you'll need at least:
 - libgpg-error 1.0  [ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/]
 - libgcrypt 1.2.0   [ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/]

If you install these with a package manager, you'll probably need the
-dev or -devel versions of the packages.

On Fedora, these packages are:
    libgpg-error-devel libgcrypt-devel

On Debian (testing or unstable), they are:
    libgpg-error-dev libgcrypt11-dev

COMPILING

If you're got a CVS copy, you will need to regenerate the configure
script using:

    autoreconf -s -i

Once you have the configure script (which comes with the source
deistribution), run it with the "--with-pic" option, as well as any
other options that may be necessary for your system.  Some examples:

Linux:
    ./configure --with-pic --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man

NETBSD:
    CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" LDFLAGS="-R/usr/pkg/lib -L/usr/pkg/lib" \
	./configure --with-pic --prefix=/usr/pkg

mingw cross-compiler from Debian Linux:
    ./configure --with-pic --build=`./config.guess` --host=i586-mingw32msvc \
	--prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc

Once the configure script writes a Makefile, you should be able to just
run "make".

INSTALLATION

You should be able to simply do "make install".  If you want to install
somewhere other than / (this is useful for package creators), use
something like "make DESTDIR=/path/to/install/to install".
