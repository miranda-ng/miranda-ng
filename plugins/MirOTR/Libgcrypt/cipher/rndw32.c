 Hi,

 Sure.  I assumed that since GPG was GPLd, you'd prefer the GPL for the entropy
 code as well, but Ian asked for LGPL as an option so as of the next release
 I'll have LGPL in there.  You can consider it to be retroactive, so your
 current version will be LGPLd as well.

 Peter.

  /* Get information from the system performance counters.  This can take a
     few seconds to do.  In some environments the call to RegQueryValueEx()
     can produce an access violation at some random time in the future, in
     some cases adding a short delay after the following code block makes
     the problem go away.  This problem is extremely difficult to
     reproduce, I haven't been able to get it to occur despite running it
     on a number of machines.  MS knowledge base article Q178887 covers
     this type of problem, it's typically caused by an external driver or
     other program that adds its own values under the
     HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA key.  The NT kernel, via Advapi32.dll, calls the
     required external module to map in the data inside an SEH try/except
     block, so problems in the module's collect function don't pop up until
     after it has finished, so the fault appears to occur in Advapi32.dll.
     There may be problems in the NT kernel as well though, a low-level
     memory checker indicated that ExpandEnvironmentStrings() in
     Kernel32.dll, called an interminable number of calls down inside
     RegQueryValueEx(), was overwriting memory (it wrote twice the
     allocated size of a buffer to a buffer allocated by the NT kernel).
     OTOH this could be coming from the external module calling back into
     the kernel, which eventually causes the problem described above.

     Possibly as an extension of the problem that the krnlWaitSemaphore()
     call above works around, running two instances of cryptlib (e.g. two
     applications that use it) under NT4 can result in one of them hanging
     in the RegQueryValueEx() call.  This happens only under NT4 and is
     hard to reproduce in any consistent manner.

     One workaround that helps a bit is to read the registry as a remote
     (rather than local) registry, it's possible that the use of a network
     RPC call isolates the calling app from the problem in that whatever
     service handles the RPC is taking the hit and not affecting the
     calling app.  Since this would require another round of extensive
     testing to verify and the NT native API call is working fine, we'll
     stick with the native API call for now.

     Some versions of NT4 had a problem where the amount of data returned
     was mis-reported and would never settle down, because of this the code
     below includes a safety-catch that bails out after 10 attempts have
     been made, this results in no data being returned but at does ensure
     that the thread will terminate.

     In addition to these problems the code in RegQueryValueEx() that
     estimates the amount of memory required to return the performance
     counter information isn't very accurate (it's much worse than the
     "slightly-inaccurate" level that the MS docs warn about, it's usually
     wildly off) since it always returns a worst-case estimate which is
     usually nowhere near the actual amount required.  For example it may
     report that 128K of memory is required, but only return 64K of data.

     Even worse than the registry-based performance counters is the
     performance data helper (PDH) shim that tries to make the counters
     look like the old Win16 API (which is also used by Win95).  Under NT
     this can consume tens of MB of memory and huge amounts of CPU time
     while it gathers its data, and even running once can still consume
     about 1/2MB of memory */

  /* The performance of QPC varies depending on the architecture it's
     running on and on the OS, the MS documentation is vague about the
     details because it varies so much.  Under Win9x/ME it reads the
     1.193180 MHz PIC timer.  Under NT/Win2K/XP it may or may not read the
     64-bit TSC depending on the HAL and assorted other circumstances,
     generally on machines with a uniprocessor HAL
     KeQueryPerformanceCounter() uses a 3.579545MHz timer and on machines
     with a multiprocessor or APIC HAL it uses the TSC (the exact time
     source is controlled by the HalpUse8254 flag in the kernel).  That
     choice of time sources is somewhat peculiar because on a
     multiprocessor machine it's theoretically possible to get completely
     different TSC readings depending on which CPU you're currently
     running on, while for uniprocessor machines it's not a problem.
     However, the kernel appears to synchronise the TSCs across CPUs at
     boot time (it resets the TSC as part of its system init), so this
     shouldn't really be a problem.  Under WinCE it's completely platform-
     dependant, if there's no hardware performance counter available, it
     uses the 1ms system timer.
     
     Another feature of the TSC (although it doesn't really affect us here)
     is that mobile CPUs will turn off the TSC when they idle, Pentiums
     will change the rate of the counter when they clock-throttle (to
     match the current CPU speed), and hyperthreading Pentiums will turn
     it off when both threads are idle (this more or less makes sense,
     since the CPU will be in the halted state and not executing any
     instructions to count).
     
     To make things unambiguous, we detect a CPU new enough to call RDTSC
     directly by checking for CPUID capabilities, and fall back to QPC if
     this isn't present.  */
