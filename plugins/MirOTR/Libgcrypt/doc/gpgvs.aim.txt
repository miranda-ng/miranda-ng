AIM
~~~
the aim of *.vs projects is to provide a well organized
and not invasive way to build target open source projects
using visual studio (vs.6 and vs.net)

~~~~~~
REASON
~~~~~~
In many situations I was obliged to use visual studio in
writing projects, and writing windows software is best suited
using this ide.
When I had need to use these great open source projects in
my applications, I had to use the binaries provided (if) for
the win32 environment: but, I think, if it can run in win32,
it could also be built using win32 compiler/linker.
I know you have to pay for visual studio, but why don't give
the opportunity to build using this tool too?
Moreover I think that providing these projects could increment
the number of coworker programmers.
So I decided to provide these visual studio projects.
