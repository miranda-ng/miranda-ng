Last Seen Mod
*************
I did some (quick'n'dirty) modifications to LastSeen plugin to fit better to my taste:

   1. ICQ IPs are logged correctly;
   2. Variables can be used in the log filename. You could have separate files for different protocols/contacts or create new file each month;
   3. Rewritten "Protocols to watch". Now selecting/deselecting protocols is easy ;)
   4. Solved enable/disable file logging bug
   5. Introduced 6 new variables:
          * %P - protocol name (ICQ, ICQ1, MSN...);
          * %N - nick on the server;
          * %C - Client Info;
          * %G - Group;
          * %o - Old status;
          * %T - Status message
   6. Option to use # instead of % to get empty strings instead of <unknown>
   7. extended support of multiple yahoo protocols(not tested);
   8. extended support for jabber/s.
   9. popup support
  10. delayed logging to wait for the protocols to update all the settings
  11. option to track idle statuses
