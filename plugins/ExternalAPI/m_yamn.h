//================================== YAMN SERVICES ==================================
//

//GetFcnPtr Service
//Your plugin can co-operate with YAMN in 2 ways: with Miranda services and with YAMN exported functions
//Some commands are written in services, some are functions. The advantage of function calling instead of
//service calling is, that your code is more clear and it is faster than service calling (smaller, FASTER,
//easier- it is slogan of Miranda, isn't it ?). Miranda service has only 2 parameters, that can be
//disadvantage too.
//In every way, it is discutable which functions should be exported or if they should be implemented as
//services. And if YAMN should export some functions etc. Functions not used very often are now implemented
//as Miranda services.
//
//This service gets pointer to YAMN function. Then you can use function directly. In m_?????.h files you have
//definitions of some functions, with definitions of structure variable, so you can use functions very
//clearly, just look to header file.
//WPARAM- function ID. It is string representating function you need to get pointer (e.g. YAMN_WRITEWAITID)
//LPARAM- not used now, but set it to 0
//returns pointer to YAMN function or NULL when functions does not exist

//GetVariables Service
