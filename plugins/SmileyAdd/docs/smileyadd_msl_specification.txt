
MSL (ASL) - Miranda Smiley Library specification
Used for Smiley definitions
Authors: Peacow, borkra
 
This file defines relationships between text smiley codes and images 
Images could be packed into library (dll, icl) or could be standalone
images of ico, gif, png, tiff, jpeg, bmp formats      

To support Unicode definitions for smileys, smiley pack should be stored as Unicode.
Supported text formats for smiley pack file are: ANSI, UTF-16(Unicode) and UTF-8

The simplest way to do that in Notepad (for instance) select Save As and then choose Unicode encoding 

Format:
 
';' - any line that starts from this character considered comment

Smiley definition guide:

There are 2 styles of smiley definition string:

1) Smileys with plain text replacement
 
Smiley = "resourcefile", recourceindex, "smiley1 smiley2 ...", "tooltip text"

2) Smileys with regular expression replacement

Smiley = "resourcefile", recourceindex, R"smiley regular expression", "insert text", "tooltip text"

3) Smileys as services

Smiley = "resourcefile", recourceindex, S"service name|parmeter1|parameter2", "tooltip text"
  
4) Smileys as text (this is pseudo smiley, just text replacement occurs)

Smiley = "", 0, "smiley1 smiley2 ...", "replacement text"
Smiley = "", 0, R"smiley regular expression", "insert text", "replacement text"


Description of fields:
  
  - resourcefile - path or URL to the file containign the image (it could be absolute or relative) 
       
  - recourceindex - positive value: relative index in the file
                    negative value: resouridentifier.. -100 is resID 100, see ExtractIcon() on the MSDN, 
                    for gif images it's a frame number, that will be displayed if animation is disabled or not available

  - smiley? - defines space seprated list character sequencies, that should be interpreted as smiley 
  
  - smiley regular expression - defines regular expression that should be used for parsing smileys 
  
  - insert text - defines text that will be inserted when smiley clicked in smiley selector,
                  for non regular expression smiley this will be the first smiley in smiley? field 

  - tooltip text (optional). 
 
  - service name - name of any Miranda service, if service name starts with '/' protocol service for the contact assumed
  
  - parmeter1 & parameter2 - could be any number, hContact (will be resolved into contact handle) or any string
 
 Spaces and " require special handling in the smiley definition file 
 
 In all fields except regular expression fields:
 
 %%__%% or  %%_%% character sequence should be used in place of space  
 %%''%%  character sequence should be used in place of " (double quote)
 
 In regular expression fields:
 
 spaces should be defined as \s (as usual)
 double quotes should be defined as \x22
 


For icons in smiley pack the following rules apply:  

If the resourcefile contains multiple icons for one id, the 
best color/resolution one will be selected, this allows to 
auto select the 32bit alphablend on WinXP and lower quality on others
NOTE on the icon size: only in .dll and .ico the size of the resource will
be taken. All other .icl, etc will scale everything to 16x16.
