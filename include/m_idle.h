or the OS level - the user has optional two settings, one for "short" idle and another
for "long" idle. Thie module will generate long/short events based on these user preferences
and other information too. If you are unsure which idle mode to report for, report it
for short idle.*/

	Note: You will get multiple calls with IDF_ISIDLE set, the first is for short idle
		then long idle, then anytime during you might get IDF_ONFORCE if the screensaver or station
		become locked.

		It is up to you to keep state, i.e. once the idle that you care about is reported
		ignore other status notifications with IDF_ISIDLE set until you get one with IDF_ISIDLE isn't
		set.
