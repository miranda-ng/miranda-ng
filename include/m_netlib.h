/* Notes on HTTP gateway usage
When a connection is initiated through an HTTP proxy using
MS_NETLIB_OPENCONNECTION, netlib will GET nlu.szHttpGatewayHello and read
the replied headers. Once this succeeds nlu.pfnHttpGatewayInit will be called
with a valid handle to the connection, the NETLIBOPENCONNECTION structure that
MS_NETLIB_OPENCONNECTION was called with, and the replied HTTP headers as its
parameters. This function is responsible for recving and parsing the data then
calling MS_NETLIB_SETHTTPPROXYINFO with the appropriate information.
nlu.pfnHttpGatewayInit should return nonzero on success. If it returns zero
then the entire connection attempt will return signalling failure. If your
function needs to return an error code it can do so via SetLastError().
If nlu.pfnHttpGatewayInit returns success without having called
MS_NETLIB_SETHTTPPROXYINFO then the connection attempt will fail anyway.
If you need more fine-tuned control over the GET/POST URLs than just appending
sequence numbers you can call MS_NETLIB_SETHTTPPROXYINFO from within your
wrap/unwrap functions (see below).

Just prior to MS_NETLIB_OPENCONNECTION returning nlu.pfnHttpGatewayBegin is
called with the handle to the connection and the NETLIBOPENCONNECTION structure
as its parameters. This is for gateways that need special non-protocol
initialisation. If you do send any packets in this function, you probably want
to remember to use the MSG_NOHTTPGATEWAYWRAP flag. This function pointer can be
NULL if this functionality isn't needed. This function must return nonzero on
success. If it fails the connect attempt will return failure without changing
LastError.

Whenever MS_NETLIB_SEND is called on a connection through an HTTP proxy and
the MSG_NOHTTPGATEWAYWRAP flags is not set and nlu.pfnHttpGatewayWrapSend is
not NULL, nlu.pfnHttpGatewayWrapSend will be called *instead* of sending the
data. It is this function's responsibility to wrap the sending data
appropriately for transmission and call pfnNetlibSend to send it again.
The flags parameter to nlu.pfnHttpGatewayWrapSend should be passed straight
through to the pfnNetlibSend call. It has already been ORed with
MSG_NOHTTPGATEWAYWRAP. nlu.pfnHttpGatewayWrapSend should return the a
number of the same type as MS_NETLIB_SEND, ie the number of bytes sent or
SOCKET_ERROR. The number of wrapping bytes should be subtracted so that the
return value appears as if the proxy wasn't there.
pfnNetlibSend() is identical to CallService(MS_NETLIB_SEND, ...) but it's
quicker to call using this pointer than to do the CallService() lookup again.

Whenever an HTTP reply is received inside MS_NETLIB_RECV the headers and data
are read into memory. If the headers indicate success then the data is passed
to nlu.pfnHttpGatewayUnwrapRecv (if it's non-NULL) for processing. This
function should remove (and do other processing if necessary) all HTTP proxy
specific headers and return a pointer to the buffer whose size is returned in
*outBufLen. If the buffer needs to be resized then NetlibRealloc() should be
used for that purpose, *not* your own CRT's realloc(). NetlibRealloc() behaves
identically to realloc() so it's possible to free the original buffer and
create a new one if that's the most sensible way to write your parser.
If errors are encountered you should SetLastError() and return NULL;
MS_NETLIB_RECV will return SOCKET_ERROR. If the passed buffer unwraps to
contain no actual data you should set *outBufLen to 0 but make sure you return
some non-NULL buffer that can be freed.

When you call MS_NETLIB_SEND or MS_NETLIB_RECV from any of these functions, you
should use the MSG_DUMPPROXY flag so that the logging is neat.
