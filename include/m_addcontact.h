	Notes:

	During 0.3.0.0 development (circa 2003/06/08)

	An entire copy of the ADDCONTACTSTRUCT structure is made,
	the PROTOSEARCHRESULT is also copied at psr->cbSize, all default
	strings are copied (even if they're not needed/used)
	if you pass a structure that is bigger than PROTOSEARCHRESULT
	then do not use pointers in the newly defined area because
	they will not be copied.

	passing wParam == NULL will result in a dialog that is created modeless

	Before the circa, a modal dialog was *always* created and
	strings within PROTOSEARCHRESULT were not copied.
