/*

  A protocol might not support this cap, it allows a protocol to say that PFLAGNUM_2 is for
  statuses contacts supports, and that PFLAGNUM_5 is for statuses a protocol can SET TO ITSELF,
  if this is not replied to, then PFLAGNUM_2 is alone in telling you which statuses a protocol
  can set to and what statuses a contact can set to as well.

  E.g. A protocol might report 'wireless' users but a login of the protocol from Miranda can
  not set itself to 'wireless' so PFLAGNUM_2 would return PF2_ONTHEPHONE and PFLAGNUM_5 would
  return PF2_ONTHEPHONE as well, this means "I will get contacts who are on the phone but you can
  not set on the phone" and so on.

  Do note that the reply here is a NEGATION of bitflags reported for PFLAGNUM_2, e.g. returning
  PF2_ONTHEPHONE for PFLAGNUM_2 and returning the same for PFLAGNUM_5 says that you DO NOT SUPPORT
  PF2_ONTHEPHONE for the user to PS_SETSTATUS to, but you will expect other contacts to have
  that status, e.g. you can get onthephone for users but can't go online with onthephone.

  The same PF2_* status flags are used in the reply.

/* Deleting contacts from protocols that store the contact list on the server:
If a contact is deleted while the protocol is online, it is expected that the
protocol will have hooked me_db_contact_deleted and take the appropriate
action by itself.
If a contact is deleted while the protocol is offline, the contact list will
display a message to the user about the problem, and set the byte setting
"CList"/"Delete" to 1. Each time such a protocol changes status from offline
or connecting to online the contact list will check for contacts with this
flag set and delete them at that time. Your hook for me_db_contact_deleted
will pick this up and everything will be good.
