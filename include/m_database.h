/******************* DATABASE MODULE ***************************/

/*	Notes (as I think of them):
- The module is 100% thread-safe
- The database is the main routing point for the vast majority of Miranda.
  Events are sent from the protocol module to here, and the send/recv message
  module (for example) hooks the db/event/added event. Events like 'contact
  online status changed' do not come through here - icqlib will send that one.
- contacts work much the same. the find/add users module calls db/contact/add
  and db/contact/writesetting and the contact list will get db/contact/added
  and db/contact/settingchanged events
- The user is just a special contact. A hcontact of NULL in most functions
  means the user. Functions in which it cannot be used will be stated
- events attached to the user are things like system messages
- also in this module are crypt/decrypt functions for stuff that should be
  obfuscated on the disk, and some time functions for dealing with timestamps
  in events.
- the contactsettings system is designed for being read by many different
  modules. eg lots of people will be interested in "ICQ"/"UIN", but the module
  name passed to contact/writesetting should always be your own. The Mirabilis
  ICQ database importer clearly has to be an exception to this rule, along with
  a few other bits.
- the current database format means that geteventcontact is exceptionally slow.
  It should be avoidable in most cases so I'm not too concerned, but if people
  really need to use it a lot, I'll sort it out.
- handles do not need to be closed unless stated
- the database is loaded as a memory mapped file. This has various
  disadvantages but a massive advantage in speed for random access.
- The database is optimised for reading. Write performance is fairly bad,
  except for adding events which is the most common activity and pretty good.
- I'll work on caching to improve this later
- Deleted items are left as empty space and never reused. All new items are
  put at the end. A count is kept of this slack space and at some point a
  separate programme will need to be written to repack the database when the
  slack gets too high. It's going to be a good few months of usage before this
  can happen to anyone though, so no rush.

it would have been at the time and date the stamp contains.

speed up the process. If you do switch it off, you must remember that crashes
are far more likely to be catastrophic, so switch it back on at the earliest
