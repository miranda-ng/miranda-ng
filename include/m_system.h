//The Miranda message loop has a MsgWaitForMultipleObjects() call in it to
//implement this feature. See the documentation for that function for
//information on what objects are supported.
//There is a limit of MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS minus one (MWO is defined in winnt.h

//As of writing, the following parts of Miranda are thread-safe, so can be
//called from any thread:
//All of modules.h except NotifyEventHooks()
//Read-only parts of m_database.h (since the write parts will call hooks)
//All of m_langpack.h
//for all other routines your mileage may vary, but I would strongly recommend
//that you call them from the main thread, or ask about it on plugin-dev if you
//think it really ought to work.

//Update during 0.1.2.0 development, 16/10/01:
//NotifyEventHooks() now translates all calls into the context of the main
//thread, which means that all of m_database.h is now completely safe.

//Update during 0.1.2.2 development, 17/4/02:
//The main thread's message loop now also deals with asynchronous procedure
//calls. Loop up QueueUserAPC() for a neater way to accomplish a lot of the
//things that used to require ms_system_waitonhandle.

//Miranda is compiled with the multithreaded runtime - don't forget to do the
//same with your plugin.
