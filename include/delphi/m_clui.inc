             the group or not.
             -
             this is also called when the contact list is being rebuilt,

    Notes  : this contact is NOT actually being deleted, since if
             a contact goes offline while 'hide offline' option is sset,
             this service will be called then ALSO

    Notes  : the caller processes the 'hide offline' setting, so the callee
             should not do further processing based on the value of this setting
             -
             WARNING: this will be called to re-add a contact when they come
             online if 'hide offline' is on, but it cannot determine if
             the contact is already on the list, so you may get requests to
             add a contact when it is already on the list, which you should ignore.
             -
             You'll also get this whenever an event is added for a contact,
             since if the contact was offline, it needs to be shown to
             display the mesage, even if 'hide offlines' is on.
             -
             you should not resort the list on this call, a seperate resort
             request will be sent.
             -
