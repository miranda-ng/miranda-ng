[You're going to copy the complete history of #{source_name} (#{source_proto}) to #{target_name} (#{target_proto}). Afterwards, the target history will contain entries from both histories. There is no way to revert this operation. Be careful! This is a rather big operation and has the potential to damage your database. Be sure to have a backup of this database before performing this operation.\r\n\r\nAre you sure you would like to continue?]
