[The server did not respond to the connection attempt within a reasonable time, it may be temporarily down. Try again later.]

[The connection with the server was abortively closed during the connection attempt. You may have lost your local network connection.]

[Miranda was unable to resolve the name of a server to its numeric address. This is most likely caused by a catastrophic loss of your network connection (for example, your modem has disconnected), but if you are behind a proxy, you may need to use the 'Resolve hostnames through proxy' option in M->Options->Network.]

[Miranda was unable to make a connection with a server. It is likely that the server is down, in which case you should wait for a while and try again later.]

[Your proxy rejected the user name and password that you provided. Please check them in M->Options->Network.]

[The server to which you are trying to connect does not exist. Check your spelling in M->Options->Network->ICQ.]
