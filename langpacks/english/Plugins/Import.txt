[This wizard will help you import contacts and message history from another Miranda profile or from an external program.]
[Click "Next" to choose the information you wish to import, or click "Cancel" to exit the wizard and continue using Miranda.]
[It is recommended that you create a backup of your current Miranda profile before importing.]
[If you wish to import more information, click "Next" to return to the start of the wizard, otherwise click "Finish" to start using Miranda.]
[You will probably never need to use this wizard again, so you can save memory by not loading it every time you start Miranda. This will mean that the import menu item will no longer be available.]
[Do not load the import plugin at startup again]

[If at a future date you wish to use the wizard again, you can make it load again by going to the Plugins section of the Options dialog box.]
