Be careful when you use this function as you can only pass numbers and strings as data.\nNOTE: If you pass invalid data to a service, Miranda might crash.]

You can use \\n for new line (and \\\\n for \\n).]

To search for a specific account use the keyword 'account:<account>'. To search for contacts that have a certain ID use the keyword 'id:<id>'. To search for contacts that have a certain status use 'status:<status>'.\n  contacts open [<keyword> [account:<account>] [id:<id>] [status:<status>] [<keyword> [...]]].\nThe command will open a message window for all contacts that match the search criteria. To search for a specific account use the keyword 'account:<account>'. To search for contacts that have a certain ID use the keyword 'id:<id>'. To search for contacts that have a certain status use 'status:<status>'. If no keyword is specified, the command will open a message window for all contacts that have unread messages.]
[Shows history or unread messages for a contact.\nUsage: history <command> <contact>.\n<Command> is one of the following commands:\n  unread - show unread messages for that contact.\n  show <contact> <start> <finish> - show history from event number <start> to <finish>. If any number is negative, it is interpreted as a relative index from the last event number +1 (so the last event for a contact is -1).]
[Shows version information for Miranda and CmdLine plugin. If CrashDumper plugin is installed, it will use its report instead.\nUsage: version.\nThe command will print Miranda's and CmdLine's version numbers or, if CrashDumper plugin is installed, it will show Version Info report.]
