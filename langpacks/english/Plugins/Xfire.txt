[If you add a mod of a Xfire supported game, then you can specify what gameid will be sent to Xfire. So if you add a Half-Life mod, you can set the Half-Life game id and if you start the game, your Xfire buddies will see the Half-Life game icon next to your name and the game time will be tracked.]
[Every game in Xfire needs an id. Use a number above the last used id to avoid problems with used ids. Every number above 10000 should be save. This id will not be sent to Xfire, when you start a game.]
[Please enter a game name.]
[Please enter a game id.]
[Please enter a game id above 1.]
