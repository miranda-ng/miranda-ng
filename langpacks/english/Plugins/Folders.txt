[Variable string]
[What it expands to:]
[Expands to your Miranda path (e.g., c:\\program files\\miranda ng).]
[Expands to your profile path - the value found in mirandaboot.ini,]
[ProfileDir section (usually inside Miranda's folder).]
[Expands to your current profile name without the extenstion.]
[(e.g., default if your your profile is default.dat).]
[Environment variables]
[The plugin can also expand environment variables; the variables are specified like in any other]
[program that can use environment variables, i.e., %<env variable>%.]
[Note: Environment variables are expanded before any Miranda variables. So if you have, for]
[example, %profile_path% defined as a system variable then it will be expanded to that value]
[instead of expanding to Miranda's profile path.]
[Examples:]
[If the value for the ProfileDir inside mirandaboot.ini, ProfileDir section is '.\\profiles\\', current]
[profile is 'default.dat' and Miranda path is 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\' then:]
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng']
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\profiles']
[will expand to 'default']
[will expand to the temp folder of the current user.]
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\profiles\\default']
[will expand to 'c:\\program files\\miranda ng\\plugins\\config']
[Notice that the spaces at the beginning and the end of the string are trimmed, as well as the last.]
