[Lotus Notes Extension Manager was not registered. Authentication function will not work properly]
[This utility check your notes.ini file if it's set to authenticate this plugin as safe. Plugin is not added as Lotus Extension, so plugin built-in authentication will not work properly. Do you want to add plugin as Lotus Extension (modify notes.ini by adding "EXTMGR_ADDINS=PLUGINNAME")?]
