[No more spam! Robots can't go! Only human beings invited!\r\n\r\nThis plugin works pretty simple:\r\nWhile messages from users on your contact list go as there is no any anti-spam software, messages from unknown users are not delivered to you. But also they are not ignored, this plugin replies with a simple question, and if user gives the right answer plugin adds him to your contact list so that he can contact you.]
