To search for a specific account use the keyword 'account:<account>'. To search for contacts that have a certain ID use the keyword 'id:<id>'. To search for contacts that have a certain status use 'status:<status>'. If no keyword is specified, the command will open a message window for all contacts that have unread messages.]

If any number is negative, it is interpreted as a relative index from the last event number +1 (so the last event for a contact is -1).]
