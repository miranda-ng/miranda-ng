[The token %subject% is translated into a special contact, which depends on the situation in which the string is parsed. Use this dialog to simulate the contact to which %subject% translates. An example for using this token is: !cinfo(%subject%,display).]
[Description]
[Setting]
[The token %extratext% is translated into a string which depends on the situation in which the string is parsed. Use this dialog to simulate the string to which %extratext% translates.]
[The Variables plugin translates various tokens into a certain value. An example is: I'm running Miranda %mirandaversion%. The substring %mirandaversion% will be translated into the correct version number. The following list shows all available tokens.]

[--- Special characters ---\r\n\r\nThe following characters have a special meaning in a formatting string:\r\n\r\n?<function>(<arguments>)\r\nThis will parse the function given the arguments, the result will be parsed again. Example: Today is ?cdate(yyyy/MM/dd).\r\n\r\n!<function>(<arguments>)\r\nThis will parse the function given the arguments, the result will not be parsed again. Example: Message waiting: !message(,first,rcvd,unread).\r\n\r\n%<field>%\r\nThis will parse the given field. Example: I installed Miranda at: %mirandapath%.\r\n\r\n`<string>`\r\nThis will not parse the given string, any function, field or special character in the string will shown in the result without being translated. Example: Use `%mirandapath%` to show the installation path.\r\n\r\n#<comment>\r\nThis will add a comment in the formatting string. Everything from the # character to the end of the line will be removed. Example: %dbprofile% #this is a useless comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Contacts ---\r\n\r\nWhenever a functions requires a contact as an argument, you can specify it in two ways:\r\n\r\n(1) Using a unique ID (UIN for ICQ, email for MSN) or, a protocol ID followed by a unique ID in the form <PROTOID:UNIQUEID>, for example <MSN:miranda@hotmail.com> or <ICQ:123456789>.\r\n\r\n(2) Using the contact function:\r\n?contact(x,y)\r\nA contact will be searched which will have value x for its property y, y can be one of the following:\r\nfirst, last, nick, email, ID or display\r\n\r\nFor example: ?contact(miranda@hotmail.com,email) or ?contact(Miranda,nick). The contact function will return either a unique contact according to the arguments or nothing if none or multiple contacts exists with the given property.]
