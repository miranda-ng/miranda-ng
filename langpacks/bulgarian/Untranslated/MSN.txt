[Automatic authentication to MSN failed, possibly due to Captcha-Authentication. Do you want to open a browser window to do a manual login?\n\nThis will not log you in to MSN in Miranda, but it allows you to fix potential problems like entering a captcha that gets asked due to location change or to accept new TOS, which are required only once.\n\nAlso please note that MSN protocol doesn't support two-factor authentication.]
