[Database encryption mode]
[Standard]
[Total]
[Only critical data are encrypted (passwords, security tokens, etc). All another settings and history remains unencrypted. Fast and effective, suitable for the most cases]
[All string settings and all events in histories are encrypted. It also makes Miranda much slower and creates a risk of losing everything you've stored in a profile in case of losing password. Recommended only for paranoid users]
[Miranda has detected corruption in your database. This corruption may be fixed by DbChecker plugin. Please download it from http://miranda-ng.org/p/DbChecker/. Miranda will now shut down.]
[This profile is too old to be updated with PluginUpdater, your database must be converted first.\n\nWould you like to read how to fix this?]
