[If you add a mod of an Xfire supported game, then you can specify what game ID will be sent to Xfire. So if you add a Half-Life mod, you can set the Half-Life game ID and if you start the game, your Xfire buddies will see the Half-Life game icon next to your name and the game time will be tracked.]

[Every game in Xfire needs an ID. Use a number above the last used ID to avoid problems with used IDs. Every number above 10000 should be save. This ID will not be sent to Xfire, when you start a game.]

[Please enter a game name.]

[Please enter a game ID.]

[Please enter a game ID above 1.]
