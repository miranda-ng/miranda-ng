[No more spam! Robots can't go! Only human beings invited!\r\n\r\nThis plugin works pretty simple:\r\nWhile messages from users on your contact list go as there is no any anti-spam software, messages from unknown users are not delivered to you. But also they are not ignored, this plugin replies with a simple question, and if user gives the right answer, plugin adds him to your contact list so that he can contact you.]

[Spammers made me to install small anti-spam system you are now speaking with.\r\nPlease reply "nospam" without quotes and spaces if you want to contact me.]

[StopSpam: send a message and reply to an anti-spam bot question.]

[Congratulations! You just passed human/robot test. Now you can write me a message.]

[If math expression is turned on, you can use following expression in message text:\nXX+XX-X/X*X\neach X will be replaced by one random number and answer will be expression result.\nMessage must contain only one expression without spaces.]
