### Expected behavior
What did you expect?

### Actual behavior
What did you get instead?

### Does it work in stable version?
If you know in which dev build (or approximate date when) it was broken, it may be much easier to identify and fix the issue.

### Steps to reproduce that behavior
 * Provide step-by-step instructions so we can reproduce the issue (We can't fix what we can't reproduce).
 * Attach your VersionInfo.
 * Attach a crash report if you are experiencing crashes (It includes VersionInfo as well).
 * Attach a network log captured if you are experiencing connectivity issues.
 * If Miranda freezes, hangs up or consumes CPU, attach information obtained by Process Explorer tool.
