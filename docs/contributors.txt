Our plugin developers, too multitudinous to name individually, but whos works are nontheless crucial to our success.  
Special mention to Scott Ellis, a welcome part of arguably almost every Miranda IM installation :)

Our translators, who have done great things to expand our reach, and who are infuriated that 
I won't let them change this text.

Our media developers, who bring us the icons, sounds and skins you love so much.
Special mention to Angeli-Ka, a0x, Faith Healer, Quadrone, and Valkyre for their work on the application icons.

Our bug reporters and moderators, who strive thanklessly to bring quality into Miranda.
Special mention to Piotr Lukaszewski aka nowotny, not always smiling, but always doing his part.

Our forum residents, who discover new and exciting ways to break Miranda daily and who are the gestalt
 slash 'mob' that shapes how Miranda IM works and evolves.

Our users,  who...er...use it, and without who...well...we love that you love Miranda.
