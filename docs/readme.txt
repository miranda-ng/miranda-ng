3. Troubleshooting
------------------
If you have problems with Miranda:

a) Disable all plugins. If the problem is gone now, it was probably a
   bug in one of the plugins and not in Miranda NG itself.
b) Update to the latest alpha version.
   We regularly fix bugs in Miranda NG. If you are having a problem it
   might help to upgrade to the latest alpha version, maybe we already
   fixed it. You will find the "Nightly alpha builds" in the "Development"
   section of our website.
c) Check the list of known bugs.
   The official buglist is available at:
   http://trac.miranda-ng.org/report
   Look here before you submit a new report, dont submit a new report if
   it has already been reported.
d) Submit a bugreport.
