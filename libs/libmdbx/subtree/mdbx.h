 *             or more of the values described here.
 *
 * Flags set by mdbx_env_set_flags() are also used:
 *  - MDBX_NOSUBDIR
 *      By default, MDBX creates its environment in a directory whose
 *      pathname is given in path, and creates its data and lock files
 *      under that directory. With this option, path is used as-is for
 *      the database main data file. The database lock file is the path
 *      with "-lock" appended.
 *
 *  - MDBX_RDONLY
 *      Open the environment in read-only mode. No write operations will
 *      be allowed. MDBX will still modify the lock file - except on
 *      read-only filesystems, where MDBX does not use locks.
 *
 *  - MDBX_WRITEMAP
 *      Use a writeable memory map unless MDBX_RDONLY is set. This uses fewer
 *      mallocs but loses protection from application bugs like wild pointer
 *      writes and other bad updates into the database.
 *      This may be slightly faster for DBs that fit entirely in RAM,
 *      but is slower for DBs larger than RAM.
 *      Incompatible with nested transactions.
 *      Do not mix processes with and without MDBX_WRITEMAP on the same
 *      environment.  This can defeat durability (mdbx_env_sync etc).
 *
 *  - MDBX_NOMETASYNC
 *      Flush system buffers to disk only once per transaction, omit the
 *      metadata flush. Defer that until the system flushes files to disk,
 *      or next non-MDBX_RDONLY commit or mdbx_env_sync(). This optimization
 *      maintains database integrity, but a system crash may undo the last
 *      committed transaction. I.e. it preserves the ACI (atomicity,
 *      consistency, isolation) but not D (durability) database property.
 *      This flag may be changed at any time using mdbx_env_set_flags().
 *
 *  - MDBX_NOSYNC
 *      Don't flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction.
 *      This optimization means a system crash can corrupt the database or
 *      lose the last transactions if buffers are not yet flushed to disk.
 *      The risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers
 *      to disk and how often mdbx_env_sync() is called.  However, if the
 *      filesystem preserves write order and the MDBX_WRITEMAP and/or
 *      MDBX_LIFORECLAIM flags are not used, transactions exhibit ACI
 *      (atomicity, consistency, isolation) properties and only lose D
 *      (durability).  I.e. database integrity is maintained, but a system
 *      crash may undo the final transactions.
 *
 *      Note that (MDBX_NOSYNC | MDBX_WRITEMAP) leaves the system with no
 *      hint for when to write transactions to disk.
 *      Therefore the (MDBX_MAPASYNC | MDBX_WRITEMAP) may be preferable.
 *      This flag may be changed at any time using mdbx_env_set_flags().
 *
 *  - MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC (internally MDBX_NOSYNC | MDBX_MAPASYNC)
 *      FIXME: TODO
 *
 *  - MDBX_MAPASYNC
 *      When using MDBX_WRITEMAP, use asynchronous flushes to disk. As with
 *      MDBX_NOSYNC, a system crash can then corrupt the database or lose
 *      the last transactions. Calling mdbx_env_sync() ensures on-disk
 *      database integrity until next commit. This flag may be changed at
 *      any time using mdbx_env_set_flags().
 *
 *  - MDBX_NOTLS
 *      Don't use Thread-Local Storage. Tie reader locktable slots to
 *      MDBX_txn objects instead of to threads. I.e. mdbx_txn_reset() keeps
 *      the slot reserved for the MDBX_txn object. A thread may use parallel
 *      read-only transactions. A read-only transaction may span threads if
 *      the user synchronizes its use. Applications that multiplex many
 *      user threads over individual OS threads need this option. Such an
 *      application must also serialize the write transactions in an OS
 *      thread, since MDBX's write locking is unaware of the user threads.
 *
 *  - MDBX_NOLOCK (don't supported by MDBX)
 *      Don't do any locking. If concurrent access is anticipated, the
 *      caller must manage all concurrency itself. For proper operation
 *      the caller must enforce single-writer semantics, and must ensure
 *      that no readers are using old transactions while a writer is
 *      active. The simplest approach is to use an exclusive lock so that
 *      no readers may be active at all when a writer begins.
 *
 *  - MDBX_NORDAHEAD
 *      Turn off readahead. Most operating systems perform readahead on
 *      read requests by default. This option turns it off if the OS
 *      supports it. Turning it off may help random read performance
 *      when the DB is larger than RAM and system RAM is full.
 *
 *  - MDBX_NOMEMINIT
 *      Don't initialize malloc'd memory before writing to unused spaces
 *      in the data file. By default, memory for pages written to the data
 *      file is obtained using malloc. While these pages may be reused in
 *      subsequent transactions, freshly malloc'd pages will be initialized
 *      to zeroes before use. This avoids persisting leftover data from other
 *      code (that used the heap and subsequently freed the memory) into the
 *      data file. Note that many other system libraries may allocate and free
 *      memory from the heap for arbitrary uses. E.g., stdio may use the heap
 *      for file I/O buffers. This initialization step has a modest performance
 *      cost so some applications may want to disable it using this flag. This
 *      option can be a problem for applications which handle sensitive data
 *      like passwords, and it makes memory checkers like Valgrind noisy. This
 *      flag is not needed with MDBX_WRITEMAP, which writes directly to the
 *      mmap instead of using malloc for pages. The initialization is also
 *      skipped if MDBX_RESERVE is used; the caller is expected to overwrite
 *      all of the memory that was reserved in that case. This flag may be
 *      changed at any time using mdbx_env_set_flags().
 *
 *  - MDBX_COALESCE
 *      Aim to coalesce records while reclaiming FreeDB. This flag may be
 *      changed at any time using mdbx_env_set_flags().

 *  - MDBX_REVERSEKEY
 *      Keys are strings to be compared in reverse order, from the end
 *      of the strings to the beginning. By default, Keys are treated as
 *      strings and compared from beginning to end.
 *  - MDBX_DUPSORT
 *      Duplicate keys may be used in the table. Or, from another point of
 *      view, keys may have multiple data items, stored in sorted order. By
 *      default keys must be unique and may have only a single data item.
 *  - MDBX_INTEGERKEY
 *      Keys are binary integers in native byte order, either uin32_t or
 *      uint64_t, and will be sorted as such. The keys must all be of the
 *      same size.
 *  - MDBX_DUPFIXED
 *      This flag may only be used in combination with MDBX_DUPSORT. This
 *      option tells the library that the data items for this database are
 *      all the same size, which allows further optimizations in storage and
 *      retrieval. When all data items are the same size, the MDBX_GET_MULTIPLE,
 *      MDBX_NEXT_MULTIPLE and MDBX_PREV_MULTIPLE cursor operations may be used
 *      to retrieve multiple items at once.
 *  - MDBX_INTEGERDUP
 *      This option specifies that duplicate data items are binary integers,
 *      similar to MDBX_INTEGERKEY keys.
 *  - MDBX_REVERSEDUP
 *      This option specifies that duplicate data items should be compared as
 *      strings in reverse order (the comparison is performed in the direction
 *      from the last byte to the first).
 *  - MDBX_CREATE
 *      Create the named database if it doesn't exist. This option is not
 *      allowed in a read-only transaction or a read-only environment.
 *
 * [out]  dbi Address where the new MDBX_dbi handle will be stored
