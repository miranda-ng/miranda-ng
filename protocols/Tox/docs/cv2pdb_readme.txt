
This is the README file for cv2pdb, a 
converter of DMD CodeView/DWARF debug information to PDB files

Copyright (c) 2009-2010 by Rainer Schuetze, All Rights Reserved

The goal of this project is to make debugging of D applications that
were created with the Digital Mars DMD compiler, as seamless as possible 
in current versions of Visual Studio (i.e Visual Studio 2008 and 
VCExpress).
As a side effect, other applications might also benefit from the 
converted debug information, like WinDbg or DMC.

Features
--------
* conversion of DMD CodeView information to PDB file
* conversion of DWARF information to PDB file
* converted line number info allows setting breakpoints
* display of variables, fields and objects in watch, local and auto window and in data tooltips
* generates generic debug info for dynamic arrays, associative arrays and delegates
* autoexp.dat allows convenient display of dynamic and associative arrays in watch windows
* demangles function names for convenient display of callstack 
* also works debugging executables built with the Digital Mars C/C++ compiler DMC

Installation
------------
Sorry, there is no full featured installer available yet, you'll have
to do some simple manual steps to use cv2pdb.

See the file INSTALL for further details.

Usage
-----

Quick start:

Simply run

   cv2pdb debuggee.exe

on your executable to debug and start the debugger, e.g.

   devenv debuggee.exe
or
   vcexpress debuggee.exe

Description:

cv2pdb.exe is a command line tool which outputs its usage information
if run without arguments:

   usage: cv2pdb [-Dversion|-C] <exe-file> [new-exe-file] [pdb-file]

With the -D option, you can specify the version of the DMD compiler
you are using. Unfortunately, this information is not embedded into
the debug information. The default is -D2. So far, this information 
is only needed to determine whether "char[]" or "const char[]" is 
translated to "string". 

Starting with DMD 2.043, assoiciative arrays have a slightly different
implementation, so debug information needs to be adjusted aswell. 
Use -D 2.043 or higher to produce the matching debug info.

Option -C tells the program, that you want to debug a program compiled
with DMC, the Digital Mars C/C++ compiler. It will disable some of the
D specific functions and will enable adjustment of stack variable names.

The first file name on the command line is expected to be the executable
or dynamic library compiled by the DMD compiler and containing the 
CodeView debug information (-g option used when running dmd).

If no further file name is given, a PDB file will be created with the
same base name as the executable, but with extension "pdb", and the 
executable will be modified to redirect debuggers to this pdb-file instead
of the original debug information.

Example:
    cv2pdb debuggee.exe

In an environment using make-like tools, it is often useful to create
a new file instead of modifying existing files. That way the file 
modification time can be used to continue the build process at the
correct step. 
If another file name is specified, the new executable is written
to this file and leaves the input executable unmodified.. The naming 
of the pdb-file will use the base name of the output file.

Example:
    cv2pdb debuggee.exe debuggee_pdb.exe

Last but not least, the resulting pdb-file can be renamed by specifying
a third file name.

Example:
    cv2pdb debuggee.exe debuggee_pdb.exe debug.pdb
