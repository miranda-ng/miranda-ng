/****************FILE SENDING FUNCTIONS*****************/
/* NOTE: This how to will be updated.
 *
 * HOW TO SEND FILES CORRECTLY:
 * 1. Use tox_new_file_sender(...) to create a new file sender.
 * 2. Wait for the callback set with tox_callback_file_control(...) to be called with receive_send == 1 and control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_ACCEPT
 * 3. Send the data with tox_file_send_data(...) with chunk size tox_file_data_size(...)
 * 4. When sending is done, send a tox_file_send_control(...) with send_receive = 0 and message_id = TOX_FILECONTROL_FINISHED
 * 5. when the callback set with tox_callback_file_control(...) is called with receive_send == 1 and control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_FINISHED
 * the other person has received the file correctly.
 *
 * HOW TO RECEIVE FILES CORRECTLY:
 * 1. wait for the callback set with tox_callback_file_send_request(...)
 * 2. accept or refuse the connection with tox_file_send_control(...) with send_receive = 1 and message_id = TOX_FILECONTROL_ACCEPT or TOX_FILECONTROL_KILL
 * 3. save all the data received with the callback set with tox_callback_file_data(...) to a file.
 * 4. when the callback set with tox_callback_file_control(...) is called with receive_send == 0 and control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_FINISHED
 * the file is done transferring.
 * 5. send a tox_file_send_control(...) with send_receive = 1 and message_id = TOX_FILECONTROL_FINISHED to confirm that we did receive the file.
 *
 * tox_file_data_remaining(...) can be used to know how many bytes are left to send/receive.
 *
 * If the connection breaks during file sending (The other person goes offline without pausing the sending and then comes back)
 * the receiver must send a control packet with send_receive == 1 message_id = TOX_FILECONTROL_RESUME_BROKEN and the data being
 * a uint64_t (in host byte order) containing the number of bytes received.
 *
 * If the sender receives this packet, he must send a control packet with send_receive == 0 and control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_ACCEPT
 * then he must start sending file data from the position (data , uint64_t in host byte order) received in the TOX_FILECONTROL_RESUME_BROKEN packet.
 *
 * To pause a file transfer send a control packet with control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_PAUSE.
 * To unpause a file transfer send a control packet with control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_ACCEPT.
 *
 * If you receive a control packet with receive_send == 1 and control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_PAUSE, you must stop sending filenumber until the other
 * person sends a control packet with send_receive == 0 and control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_ACCEPT with the filenumber being a paused filenumber.
 *
 * If you receive a control packet with receive_send == 0 and control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_PAUSE, it means the sender of filenumber has paused the
 * transfer and will resume it later with a control packet with send_receive == 1 and control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_ACCEPT for that file number.
