/*
	This plugin provides event driven chat rooms for protocols that wish to use it.
	It is built for IRC, which I also develop and is naturally biased towards IRC,
	but it should work very well with other protocols too. I will try to explain as
	careful as possible in this document how to use chat.dll

	-- General guidelines --

	There is ONE rule a protocol MUST follow to use this:

	1. Do NOT touch hContacts that has a byte "ChatRoom" set to ANYTHING other than 0! (Could be 1, 2, 3, ...)
	This is because chat.dll adds contacts to the clist using the protocol name
	supplied by the protocol. But this will naturally not work well if the
	protocol also tampers with the contacts. The value of the BYTE indicates which type of
	window/contact it is (see the GCW_* flags below). There is two exceptions to this rule:

		* You should continue to handle the right click menu items of these
		contacts as usual, by hooking the menu prebuild hook etc. Chat.dll can not
		handle this in an efficient manner!

		* You should also handle when the user deletes the contact/room from the
		contact list, as the protocol will then most likely have to send some message
		to the server that the user has left the room.

	NOTE. Chat keeps its own copies of strings passed.


	* * Example of implementing this rule * *:
	* * This is a code snippet that is common in protocols * *:



	hContact = (HANDLE) CallService(MS_DB_CONTACT_FINDFIRST, 0, 0);
	while (hContact)
	{
		szProto = (char *) CallService(MS_PROTO_GETCONTACTBASEPROTO, (WPARAM) hContact, 0);
		if (szProto != NULL && !lstrcmpi(szProto, PROTONAME))
		{
			... do something with the hContact here;
		}
		hContact = (HANDLE) CallService(MS_DB_CONTACT_FINDNEXT, (WPARAM) hContact, 0);
	}



	* * You should do this instead * *:



	hContact = (HANDLE) CallService(MS_DB_CONTACT_FINDFIRST, 0, 0);
	while (hContact)
	{
		szProto = (char *) CallService(MS_PROTO_GETCONTACTBASEPROTO, (WPARAM) hContact, 0);
		if (szProto != NULL && !lstrcmpi(szProto, PROTONAME))
		{
			if (DBGetContactSettingByte(hContact, PROTONAME, "ChatRoom", 0) == 0)
			{
				... do something with the hContact here;
			}
		}
		hContact = (HANDLE) CallService(MS_DB_CONTACT_FINDNEXT, (WPARAM) hContact, 0);
	}


	There is not more to it than that! To recapitulate: do NOT touch contacts where the
	BYTE "ChatRoom" is set to anything other than 0,






	OK, enough of the precautions, HOW DO YOU USE CHAT? In short you need to do FOUR things:

	1. REGISTER your protocol with Chat
	Only registered protocols can use Chat

	2. CREATE SESSIONS when your protocol are joining a group chat room. (One per room joined)
	These sessions will be put on the contact-list and are managed totally by chat.
	This is the reason you must obey to the "precautions" I mentioned above.
	Do not tamper directly with Chat's hContacts. Use Services provided	by Chat instead.

	3. SEND EVENTS to the sessions created in #3.
	These events reflect users joining/leaving/speaking etc.

	4. DESTROY SESSIONS when the user leaves the room (ie the session is not needed anymore).

	These four points are implemented in three services: MS_GC_REGISTER, MS_GC_NEWSESSION
	and MS_GC_EVENT.
*/


//------------------------- SERVICES ------------------------
/*
	Step 1. -- REGISTER with Chat --

	The first thing that a protocol need to do is register with Chat. This is best done
	when ALL modules has loaded (ME_SYSTEM_MODULESLOADED). The registration is
	needed to make sure that the protocol obey rule 1 mentioned above, but also to
	set protocol specific preferences.

	* Use MS_GC_REGISTER like this: CallService(MS_GC_REGISTER, 0, (LPARAM)(GCREGISTER *) &gcr;

	* returns 0 on success or error code on failure.

};

#define MS_GC_NEWSESSION  "GChat/NewChat"

/*
	Step 3 -- SEND an EVENT --

	Events is what drives Chat! After having created the session in Step 2
	it is time to make it work for real. Follow these guidelines:

	1. Start off by telling Chat what possible statuses a user can have (in the nicklist)
	by sending GC_EVENT_ADDGROUP as many times as needed. Also supply an icon
	to go with this status. Ex "Voice status" on IRC

	2.Then send "JOIN" events (GC_EVENT_JOIN) to populate the user list.
	You will need to send one event per user that should be added. As long as
	SESSION_INITDONE has not been sent these events will not show up in the log.

	3.When you are done with filling the user list it is a good time to end
	the set up phase and make the window visible by calling GC_EVENT_CONTROL event
	with wParam = SESSION_INITDONE.

	4.You will also want to send a GC_EVENT_CONTROL with wParam = SESSION_ONLINE to
	make the statusbar and the CList item go to "online" status

	You have now set up the session and made it active. A CList hContact has been added
	to the contact list and a chat room window is associated to the session. Send EVENTS to
	Chat users speaking, users joining and so on. See below for full
	list of what events are possible.

	IMPORTANT: For sending events you'll use the GCEVENT and GCDEST structures.	A GCDEST
	structure pointer is passed inside GCEVENT and it tells Chat what event type it is
	and what session it is related to. The GCDEST structure and its members are ALWAYS
	used (but the members can be NULL in some occasions). Depending on what type of event
	you are sending, the members of GCEVENT have different usage. Each event and how to
	use the members are discussed below. The "AddToLog" and "time" members are always valid
	and always mean the same. bAddToLog = TRUE means that the event is added to the disk log
	(at least when this makes sense). This can be used by Jabber for instance, when
	it needs to add channel history to the window, but without logging to disk.
	The "time" member is the timestamp of the event.(Tip. use the function time(NULL)
	to set the current time)

	NOTE. It is possible to send formatted text (bold, italics, underlined, foreground color
	and background color) to Chat by using the following identifiers in the text (pszText):

	%cXX		- set the foreground color ( XX is the zero based decimal index of the color registered in MS_GC_REGISTER.. Always use two digits )
	%C			- reset foreground color to default
	%fXX		- set the background color ( XX is the zero based decimal index of the color registered in MS_GC_REGISTER.. Always use two digits )
	%F			- reset the background color to default
	%b			- enable bold
	%B			- disable bold
	%u			- enable underlined
	%U			- disable underlined
	%i			- enable italics
	%I			- disable italics
	%r			- reset all to default
	%%			- escape the formatting. Translates to %

	IMPORTANT. If you have specified GC_COLOR or GC_BKGCOLOR when you registered you can expect to
	get these identifiers in the text you receive from Chat as well. Make sure % is ALWAYS
	translated to %% in text you send to Chat to avoid accidental formatting.
	NOTE. You will not get %cRRRGGGBBB back, instead you will get the index of the colour as
	registered with GC_REGISTER. Eg %c3 (the fourth colour of your index)

	* Use MS_GC_EVENT like this: CallService(MS_GC_EVENT, 0, (LPARAM)(GCEVENT *) &gce;

	* returns 0 on success or error code on failure
