-------------------------

AimOSCAR Alpha 7.1

-changed main connection to a different thread so that it doesn't cause miranda to hang while AimOSCAR connects.
-moved peer and proxy connection attempts to a different thread to stop freezing.
-fixed a bug that caused hanging if miranda was exited suddenly right after starting.
-AimOSCAR no longer attempts to connect if there is no username or password specified
-AimOSCAR no longer deletes the away message of a contact when one trys to view the contact's profile if that contact doesn't have a profile.
-AimOSCAR Now adds "No Profile" when attempting to view a profile of someone who does not have one.
-fixed a bug that caused viewing html away messages not to work on buddies with spaces in their name.
-If the a user does not send the port tlv with a file transfer request- AimOSCAR no-longer attempts to save the port to the db.
-When cancelling a file AimOSCAR now correctly attempts to grab a byte from the db instead of a word.
-AimOSCAR No longer keeps the direct connection listening port open while disconnected.
-AimOSCAR Now free's all malloc'd memory.
-When connecting to aol's proxy- the connection no longer timesout after the grace period has ended.
-When a file transfer is initiated with a contact and another is attempted- AimOSCAR no longer continues to attempt the second transfer even though it says it won't.
-The File Transfer Key is now removed from the db when a proxy file transfer fails(caused attempts future file transfer attempts to fail).

-------------------------

AimOSCAR Alpha 7.0

-added display name to the options dialog.
-file transfering added.
-fixed bug that causes process hanging(*ahem* file transfer bug).
-added a 'force proxy transfers' option to the options dialog.
-fixed bug that removed a user's status message from the database when their profile was requested
-added a option to specify grace period or file transfer time out(default-60 seconds, min-15 seconds, max-0xffff seconds)
-caught a bug right before the release; which, caused file transfers to fail in some cases.
-caught another bug that caused Uppercase characters to not be able to be entered in the display name box.

-------------------------

Alpha 6.9 -Bug Fix release.

-Chatting with Triton users should work(probably AOL users also)
-fixed bug that causes away messages to stay when a user previously was away.
-added online time(feature)

-------------------------

Alpha 6.8

-no more phantom contacts, and the contact list snac works again.... and brings your ????? groups back again! woohoo!

-------------------------

Alpha 6.7

-Now sends keepalive packets every 7 minutes. See if this fixes peoples disconnection problems.:-)

-------------------------

Alpha 6.6

-Changed AimOSCAR to wait five seconds before sending the ssi version to AOL if the contact list snac has not been sent by aol yet. 

-------------------------

Alpha 6.5
-fixed default group deletion if removing a user from it.
-added a check to see if a group exist before adding it
-fixed the elusive snac_contact_list bug. Apparently, aol sends an extra tlv containing the server-side list version(0x03) if the client already specified it. Because, Miranda is threaded it would sometimes specify it before the contact list was received; and because the extra data was not accounted for a buffer overrun would occur.
-Fixed some group bugs. AimOSCAR would attempt adjust groups after receiving one snac_contact_list packet before; however, AOL apparently can send multiple- so, some buddies would not have group id's specified, etc and madness would happen.
-Added some SNACs that tell the errors aol is giving via msgboxes.
-Status messages are now removed from the database if the contact isn't away anymore.
-Status messages are only retrieved if they are requested by the user now. Via, a call implemented in the core or via the HTML version I implemented. This should resolve issues were AimOSCAR was unable to request any away messages, because it already requested it's limit.
-General group handling improvements.

-------------------------

alpha 6.4

-checks to see whether a group id exist before deleting a group
-fixed all contacts deletion bug
-forgot to mention in the last version dynamic creation of some module names now occurs on start up so that duplicate code could be removed

-------------------------

AimOSCAR alpha 6.3

-changes to get groups working correctly again.
-changes to fix connection problems and hanging that can occur-(added some critical sections to prevent duplicate connection threads and restructured some of the code)
-created the SNAc for group deletion.(apparently i forgot to create it....no wonder groups were never deleted)
-Automatically removes empty server-side groups on log in(they will be added to your list before the server-side one is deleted-so expect them add once, but not after that)
-Removes any groups that become empty during the course of the connection to aol.
-Creates groups on the fly when users are added to them... for clarification(this isn't a new feature)

-------------------------

Alpha 6.2 release:

-Utf Group support- and probably bugs.
-AimOSCAR now tells if no away message is provided by the server(Some contacts do not provide one for some reason on some occasions? I checked this on gaim, and aim 5.9 and they both did not show one either. The away message is apparently absent in the packet sent by AOL even after it is requested.)
-Fixed html appearing in away messages on the buddy list.
-fixed crash that occured when changing status to away if "do not reply to request for this message" was set in the options.
-Message Delivery Confirmation is now disabled by default
-Restructured the code for saving away messages and profiles- it is now contained in the write_away_message and write_profile functions; which, makes reading the SNACs code easier and helps reduce executable size.

-------------------------

Alpha 6.1

-Now grabs the away message directly from the database if miranda hasn't aquired it yet.
-Removed some check that obviously didn't fix the random connection crashes on the buddy list SNAC.

-Changed group handling to not delete buddies in the 'Buddies' group when that group is deleted.
-'auto response' messages now indicate that they are auto response messages.
-added unique id return capablity to make AimOSCAR compatible with metacontacts.(hopefully)
-turned the the away message handler into a CRITICALSECTION so that it doesn't screw up and not set an away message.(Hopefully)

-------------------------

Alpha 5.2 released.

-Fixed a nasty bug that caused crashes when attempting to view html away messages.

-Made a small modification to the buddylist SNAC anaylsis to catch(perhaps) a random bug that occurs when retrieving the buddy list after login.

-------------------------

Alpha 4.3

-Fixed Wireless buddies to show as online(Don't be surprised when you get the two bots that AOL auto add's to your buddy list now... The change I made in the id string-e.g. emulated the offical client id string- caused aol to have THAT spectacular effect)
-And those damnedable directories should be gone for good. Hopefully.

-------------------------

Alpha 4.2

-Can now see that contacts are idle.(Turn dim idle contacts on)
-Fixed SNAC(03,0B) analysis(see: http://iserverd.khstu.ru/oscar/snac_03_0b.html)- multiple tlv's can now be read.
-On the phone status no longer shows up in the aim menu.
-Now "Is Connecting" status is now shown while AimOSCAR is connecting.
-On the phone, DnD, NA, Occupied, and out to lunch are now linked to away status.
-Free for chat is now linked to Online status.
-In certain circumstances AimOSCAR would become stuck on "Is Connecting"; and would not reconnect until Miranda was restarted.- This should not happen anymore.

-------------------------

Alpha 4.1

-Users appear in their actual aim groups.(No add, deletion, changing yet.)

-------------------------
