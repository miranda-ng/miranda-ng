Well, we now have contributions from the CenterICQ and Miranda IM teams.
Good going methinks.

* 12-Sep-2003

Releasing 0.7.1 which has a newer protocol version number.  This should hold
for a while.

* 19-May-2003

Released 0.7.  It has webcam support, yahoo chat support and a new connection
handling system.  Asynchronous connects are also possible.

* 18-Mar-2003

Michaël Kamp has added Webcam support, and Wayne Parrott has started on Yahoo
Chat support.  Things are starting to move.

Welcome to these two new members of the team.


* 19-Feb-2003

Released 0.6.3 - no real changes from 11th Feb.


* 11-Feb-2003

Added address book support.  Rodney Dawes helped make the library
versioned.  I've also added the htdocs to CVS to make updates easier.
0.6.2 should come out Real Soon Now.

The mailing list has been alive for a while.  There's been some good
discussions.

Also added documentation for the YMSG-9 protocol and the Addressbook
structure.

libyahoo2 is used in Ayttm - a fork of everybuddy.

There have been requests for a Java version/wrapper.  Any volunteers?


* 18-Oct-2002

This is a service release, mainly to fix the segfault on certain error
notification packets.


* 9-Oct-2002

0.6 has been released.  Also just found out that libyahoo2 is also used in
GNUYahoo


* 28-Sep-2002

Well, I added documentation some time ago.  It's in the README file.  I
suppose people have found it.

The good news now is that libyahoo2 is being used in many clients, the
bad news is that there's very little discussion on the mailing list.

From what has been reported to me, and what I've heard, it seems that
libyahoo2 is being used in Everybuddy, Fire, Proteus, Kopete, centericq.


Hope to come out with 0.6 Real Soon Now.


* 20-Jul-2002

Umm, ok, it's been in everybuddy for a few months, and now I'm releasing
it as a separate project.

libyahoo2 has its own life now.
