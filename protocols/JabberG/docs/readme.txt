Jabber Protocol Plugin for Miranda IM
=====================================

Installation:
  Copy jabber.dll to Miranda's plugins directory.

  If you want to have multiple jabber accounts online at the same time,
  you need to have multiple copies of jabber.dll, each with different name,
  all in Miranda's plugins directory. Note that all configurations for a
  Jabber account (including your contact list) are associated with the
  DLL's name. In addition, it is highly recommended that you do NOT choose
  the name that is in conflict with other plugins or any database categories
  used by Miranda core (use DatabaseViewer or DatabaseEditor to see what
  database categories are already in use).

  The option for sending messages with full acknowledgement is disabled
  by default. This feature works only when the jabber client at the other
  end can respond with message acknowledgement. If your messages seem to
  time out all the time, try disabling this option before reporting any bugs.
